# Getting logs for Allure TestOps in docker compose deployment


## Important

Allure TestOps must be running. So if it is malfunctioning, you need to collect the logs, then restart, not in a reverse order.

## Steps

1. Make `get-logs.sh` executable `chmod +x get-logs.sh`
2. Run the script `./get-logs.sh`
3. collect the **tar.gz** file generated by the script and attach to a tech support ticket.
